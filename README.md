# Orkestra PHP Framework

Orkestra is a lightweight and highly extensible PHP framework designed to provide a flexible foundation for web development. With a focus on ease of service provider addition, extensibility, and maintaining high code quality, Orkestra empowers developers to build robust and scalable applications.

## Features

- **Service Provider Architecture:** Easily expand the functionality of your application by adding service providers. Orkestra's modular design allows for simple integration of new components without compromising the core structure.

- **Dependency Injection (DI) Container:** Orkestra includes a powerful Dependency Injection container for managing class dependencies and performing dependency injection.

- **MVC Pattern:** Orkestra follows the Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern, providing a clear and organized structure for your application. However, it does not enforce a specific model layer, allowing compatibility with any Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) tool, such as Doctrine, or abstractions like WordPress WPDB and custom Query classes.

- **High Extensibility:** Orkestra is designed with extensibility in mind. Leverage the flexibility of the framework to adapt and extend its functionality according to the specific needs of your project.

- **Code Quality:** Prioritizing clean and maintainable code, Orkestra encourages best practices and follows coding standards to ensure a reliable and efficient development experience.
